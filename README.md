This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

KDNPlus Video Player Backend

This repository contains the backend code for the KDNPlus Video Player app.

 Getting Started

 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)
- AWS CLI (for configuring AWS services)

 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
   git clone http://github.com/KDNPlusAdmin/KDNPLUS-VIDEO-PLAYER-BY-ARTHUR-.git
   cd KDNPLUS-VIDEO-PLAYER-BY-ARTHUR-
   

2. Install dependencies:

   bash
   npm install
   

3. Configure environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   bash
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_aws_access_key_id>
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_aws_secret_access_key>
   DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=<your_dynamodb_table_name>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret_key>
   

4. Set up DynamoDB:

   Ensure that your DynamoDB table is created and properly configured with the necessary attributes.

5. Run the server:

   bash
   npm start
   

   The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

 API Endpoints

- Authentication:
  - `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user.
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate a user.

- Video Management:
  - `GET /api/videos` - Retrieve all videos.
  - `POST /api/videos` - Upload a new video.
  - `GET /api/videos/:id` - Get details of a specific video.

Testing

Use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints.

 Deployment

Deploy the backend using services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, or any other platform of your choice.
